Looks like this is my first blog post. Initially the purpose of this blog post was to iteratively test post styles and layout. However, I have decided to keep this post to explain what's to come.

Currently every other post on my site is filler as of this writing, but they'll be updated soon.  In the past year or so I taught myself front-end development, refined my design skills, and familiarized myself with Linux through blog posts, forums, videos, books and podcasts. I have written notes on various subjects and journaled my technical journey so far as it's just beginning. I plan on porting over my notes to this Jekyll based blog and typing up the rest I have in my journal.

The scope of this site is to share what I've learned, what I find interesting, what I read, my sketches and ideas, and to help people with their product or project. This site also serves as a personal branding asset to help me build a portfolio and shed more insight as to who I am and what I like to do. So if you're hiring or interested in working with me, shoot a message over! :)
